### OpenMineMap is a Minecraft mod made for the [BuildTheEarth](buildtheearth.net) project that implements a map of the Earth that corresponds to the BuildTheEarth Minecraft world. 

 - Right click on the map to copy or teleport to coordinates
 - See where you are at all times with the HUD map
 - (More coming soon)

Note that the map is specifically designed only to work with the BuildTheEarth modified dymaxion projection; the map will not work correctly with any other projection.
